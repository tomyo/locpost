We use [GUN](https://gun.eco/) to create a distributed database which is stored amongst the network participants in their local storage inside the web browser.
Each participant will keep a copy of the database and GUN will take care of keeping them in sync.

By giving access to your device location, you will join a censorship-resistant channel to exchange messages around that area.
